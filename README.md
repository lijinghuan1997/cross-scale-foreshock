# cross-scale-shocklet

test-particle simulation codes

including the ion-ULF wave interaction and the electron-whistler interaction

the code details are the same as the anomolous-resonance repository [Li et al., 2022](https://github.com/lijinghuan1997/anomalous-resonance)

Use the fortran code to obtain the particle trajectory in the velocity phase space (in the txt file)

Use matlab to deal with the particle data and generate the gyrophase spectra
